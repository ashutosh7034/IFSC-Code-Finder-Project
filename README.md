# IFSC Code Finder Project

## Project Introduction

The **IFSC Code Finder Project** is a web-based application developed using **PHP** and **MySQL** that allows users to quickly find the IFSC (Indian Financial System Code) of any bank branch. In the current manual system, users have to visit a bank branch to get the IFSC code, which can be time-consuming. This project streamlines the process by enabling users to search for IFSC codes online based on bank name, branch name, and pincode/zipcode from anywhere. The system consists of two key modules: **User Module** and **Admin Module**.

## Project Modules

### 1. User Module
The **User Module** allows users to search for IFSC codes quickly and easily using the following parameters:
- **Bank Name**
- **Branch Name**
- **Pincode/Zipcode**

Once the user enters the search criteria, the system retrieves the corresponding IFSC code from the database and displays it on the screen, providing a fast and convenient solution to the IFSC code search process.

### 2. Admin Module
The **Admin Module** allows the admin to manage the entire system, including the banks, states, cities, and branch details. Admins have full control over the data in the system and can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on bank-related data.

- **Dashboard**:  
  The admin dashboard provides a summary of the number of banks, states, and cities stored in the system, along with details about various bank branches.

- **Add Pages**:  
  In this section, the admin can add new:
  - Banks
  - States
  - Cities
  - Branch details (including IFSC code)
  
  This feature allows the admin to keep the system updated with the latest banking information.

- **Manage Pages**:  
  The admin can manage (edit or delete) existing:
  - Banks
  - States
  - Cities
  - Branch details
  
  This section ensures that the system maintains accurate and up-to-date information about all bank branches.

- **Profile Management**:  
  Admins can update their profile information, including name, contact details, and other personal information.

- **Settings**:  
  In this section, the admin can:
  - Change their password for security reasons.
  - Recover a lost password if necessary.
